# VIPB - Versatile IP Blacklister

**VIPB (Versatile IP Blacklister)** is a little tool written in Bash automates for downloading, processing, and maintaining [*IPsum*](https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum/) blacklists, and provides functionalities for firewall, ban, and log management. It uses `ipset` with `iptables` or `firewalld` (`ufw` coming soon..). It includes automation via `cron` jobs, integration with `fail2ban`, and a user-friendly interface for manual operations.

## Features

### Automated & Manual IP Ban

- **Ban IP Lists and/or Subnets**: Ban individual IPs, /16, and /24 subnets from a file.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Automatically download and process IP blacklists from [*IPsum*](https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum/).
- **Dual Blacklists**: Maintains separate lists and ipsets for automated and manual IP bans.

### Suspicious IPs to Subnets Aggregator

This function analyzes a list of potentially suspicious IP addresses, identifies patterns of repeated activity within subnets, and aggregates them into entire subnets (/24 or /16) based on user-defined tolerance thresholds.

### Daily Ban Automation (via Cron Jobs)

- **Daily Download & Ban**: Automated daily IPsum list download and ban via cron jobs.

### Firewall Integration

- **Manage `ipset`**: Creates and manages `ipset` rules for swift IP blocking.
- **Firewalls & Rules**: Integrates with both `firewalld` and `iptables` (`ufw` coming soon).
- **Fail2Ban**: Works in harmony with `Fail2Ban`.
