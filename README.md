# VIPB - Versatile IP Blacklister

Welcome to **VIPB (Versatile IP Blacklister)** â€“ a comprehensive tool written in Bash for protecting your VPS Linux server from malicious sources using `ipset` with `iptables` or `firewalld`. It includes automation via `cron` jobs, integration with `fail2ban`, and a user-friendly interface for manual operations.

**VIPB** automates downloading, processing, and maintaining [*IPsum*](https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum/) blacklists, and provides functionalities for firewall, ban, and log management.

## Features

### Automated & Manual IP Ban

- **Ban IP Lists and Subnets**: Ban individual IPs, /16, and /24 subnets from a file.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Automatically download and process IP blacklists from [*IPsum*](https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum/).
- **Threat Level Control**: Supports multiple suspicious occurrences levels (2-8).
- **Suspicious Subnets Generator**: Aggregates individual IPs into "suspicious" subnet ranges (/16 and /24).
- **Dual Blacklists**: Maintains separate lists and ipsets for automated and manual IP bans.

### Suspicious IPs to Subnets Aggregator

This function analyzes a list of potentially suspicious IP addresses, identifies patterns of repeated activity within subnets, and aggregates them into entire subnets (/24 or /16) based on user-defined tolerance thresholds.

### Daily Ban Automation (Cron Jobs)

- **Daily Download & Ban**: Automated daily IPsum list download and ban via cron jobs.
- Command-line interface for easy automation.

### Firewall Integration

- **Manage `ipset` Rules**: Creates and manages `ipset` rules for swift IP blocking.
- **Dual Integration**: Integrates with both `firewalld` and `iptables` (as fallback).
- **Fail2Ban Integration**: Works in harmony with `Fail2Ban`.

### Log Management

- **Read Common Log Files**: View logs from `auth.log`, `fail2ban.log`, etc.

### User Interface

- **Interactive Terminal UI**: Color-coded information for clarity.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: Easy-to-use system for all operations.
- **Terminal Dashboard**: Clear status updates and counters.
- **Comprehensive Logs**: Detailed system log reading capabilities.

## Usage

### Execute

Launch the interactive interface or cron jobs and automation:

```bash
./vipb.sh
```

## Functions

1. **Download IPsum Blacklist**
   - Choose threat level (2-8).
   - Higher levels are more strict but list fewer IPs, whereas lower levels include more IPs but may have false positives.

2. **Blacklist Compression**
   - Aggregates IP lists into subnet ranges, creating /24 and /16 subnet lists.

3. **Ban via Ipsets**
   - Apply IP bans from different source lists (also custom).
   - Choose between original IP lists or the optimized subnets.
   - View and manage active ipsets.

4. **Manual/User Ban**
   - Add individual IPs to manual blacklist.
   - View and remove manually banned IPs.
   - Export manual bans to a list file.

5. **Cron Jobs**
   - Set up automated daily updates.
   - Configure blacklist download schedule.
   - Manage automated ban operations.

6. **Firewall Rules**
   - Manage and refresh related firewall rules.
   - Check integration status.

7. **Logs & Info**
   - View related system and operation logs.

## Configuration

No real configuration is needed. The tool uses two main ipsets:

- `vipb-blacklist`: For automatically downloaded and processed IPs.
- `vipb-manual`: For manually added IP addresses.

### Blacklist Levels

- **Level 2**: Largest list, includes IPs found on 2+ blacklists.
- **Level 8**: Strictest filtering, only IPs found on 8+ blacklists.
- **Recommended Starting Point**: Level 4 or 5.

## Files

- `vipb.sh`: Main UI interface.
- `vipb-core.sh`: Core script for automation.
- `vipb-globals.sh`: Shared core variables and functions.
