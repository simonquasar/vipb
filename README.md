# VIPB - Versatile IP Blacklister

**VIPB (Versatile IP Blacklister)** is a robust Bash tool for downloading, processing, and maintaining [*IPsum*](https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum/) blacklists, and provides functionalities for managing firewalls and IP blacklists through automated and manual processes. It seamlessly integrates with Linux firewalls: it uses `ipset` along with `iptables` or `firewalld` (`ufw` support coming soon..). 
It includes daily automation via `cron` job and integration with `fail2ban`.

## Features

### Automated & Manual IP Ban

- **Daily Download & Ban**: Automatically download and process [*IPsum*](https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum/) blacklists every day via `cron` job.
- **Bulk Ban IP Lists**: Process entire lists of IPs and subnets from a list file.
- **Manual IP ban**: Ban/unban individual IP addresses on a separate user list.
- **Simplified Firewall Management**: Safer handling of FirewallD and ipset operations
- **New Log Extractor**: Advanced security event analysis and pattern recognition

### Aggregator: Suspicious IPs to Subnets

- **IP Compression**: Optimize IP lists into /16 and /24 subnets for efficient security.

This function analyzes a list of potentially suspicious IP addresses, identifies patterns of repeated activity within subnets, and aggregates them into entire subnets (/24 or /16) based on user-defined tolerance thresholds.

### Firewall Integration

- **Manage ipsets**: Creates and manages `ipset` rules for swift and reliable IP blocking.
- **Linux Firewall Support**:
`iptables`
`firewalld`
(`ufw` support coming soon)
- **Fail2Ban**: Works in harmony with `Fail2Ban`.

## Installation

Ensure required dependencies are installed and active:

- `ipset` 7.0+
- `firewalld` or `iptables`
- `cron`
- `curl`
- `bash` 4.0+
- *optional* `fail2ban`

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonquasar/vipb
cd vipb
chmod +x vipb.sh vipb-core.sh
```

## Usage

### User Interface
Run `sudo ./vipb.sh`

![VIPB UI](https://github.com/simonquasar/vipb/blob/main/inc/ScreenshotVIPB.png)
> [!NOTE]  
> IP lists should be in the same folder and use `.ipb` extension, with one IP per line in [CIDR](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr) notation.


### CLI Commands

Run via CLI/cron `sudo ./vipb.sh [args]`
